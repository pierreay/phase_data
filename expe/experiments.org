** [2024-03-14 jeu.] Frequency estimation                               :plot:

- Source ::
  - Phase rotation trace.
- Results ::
  - [[file:24-03-14_freq-estimation/psd.pdf]]
  - [[file:24-03-14_freq-estimation/specgram.pdf]]
  - Major frequency components of 5.5 MHz, 6.5 MHz, and 11.5 MHz.
  - High-pass filtered.

** [2024-03-19 mar.] Phasor plot                                        :plot:
:PROPERTIES:
:DIR:      24-03-19_phasor-plot
:ID:       336a19e9-d4e3-492d-bba4-f626b02fd51a
:END:

- Source ::
  - Traces of AES from the =240305_custom_firmware_phase_eval_iq= [[id:98437a5b-5d86-4097-96b1-9a069fd30a79][datasets]].
- Goal :: Plot the I/Q and/or the amplitude/phase rotation using phasor
  representation (2D without time and 3D with time).
- Results ::
  - 2D using representing time as color:

** [2024-03-21 jeu.] IQ problem                                         :issue:
:PROPERTIES:
:DIR:      24-03-21_iq-issue
:ID:       3fdf41e9-a9b9-4728-aceb-8a065e4e37f3
:END:

- Issue :: We have I and Q stored while we also have the amplitude and the
  phase rotation stored. While computing the amplitude and the phase rotation
  from the stored IQ, we don't get the same values as the stored amplitude and
  the phase rotation. See [[attachment:plot.py]].
- Source :: Storage ? Complex IQ reconstruction from integer IQ ? Polar to
  rectangular or Rectangular to polar conversion problem ?

** [2024-03-21 jeu.] Recombination using major votes              :data:plot:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e54d1023-f624-4b2b-9fca-37e153b864f5
:DIR:      24-03-21_recombination-vote
:END:

- Goal :: Test the major vote mechanism to recombine information from more than
  2 channels.
- Vote method :: Vertical 4-way major vote at bit level for best subkey guess.
- Measure method :: Use the hamming distance between real key and best key.
- Results :: Seems to always perform better than amplitude, but not always
  better than the better (unpredictable) attack among the 4.
- Plot result :: See [[attachment:attack_results.pdf]].

** [2024-04-09 mar.] Recombination using correlation coefficient  :data:plot:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       50f1a6fb-d65f-4b8c-af62-5895a4b93635
:DIR:      24-04-09_recombination-corr
:END:

- Goal :: Test the "merging" of correlation coefficient given by 2 channels.
- Recombination Method :: Inspired from POI recombination, use addition or
  multiplication to combine result of correlation coefficient.
- Measure method :: Calculating key rank && Measuring hamming distance.
- Results :: Recombination is always better and finally lead to a key rank
  smaller of on order of magnitude of 10. This method is also better than major
  votes as it 1) easily allows to perform key enumeration and estimation 2)
  leads to smaller intermediate hamming distances.
