# About

Repository of the phase data.

This repository contains the data and experiments of the project.

# Prerequisites

- To flash the firmware we used on our target devices during our attacks, the [phase_fw](https://github.com/pierreay/phase_fw.git) repository holds the source code.
- To record I/Q signals from the target device emanations using a software-defined radio (SDR), our SoapySDR receiver utility [SoapyRX](https://github.com/pierreay/soapyrx.git) must be installed.
- To process and analyze the datasets composed of I/Q signals, our side-channel experimental toolbox [SCAFF](https://github.com/pierreay/scaff.git) must be installed.
